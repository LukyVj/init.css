init.css
========

The perfect style for your project or reading pages.


## What is it 

init.css is a predifined css structure, which allows you to write with a kind of "vanilla HTML", without
extra markup. Just focus on the content, and init.css will turn it into a beautiful one-page website. 

With init.css, the reading experience is pushed at 100% to make your texts beautiful and easy to understand.

Its responsive, its css only & it works with pseudo classes `:before/:after` to bring you to a next level
of simplicity in terms of html writing for the web.
